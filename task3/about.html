<p>We are proud to annouce  that our 25th Annual Science Symposium of Amrita University will begin on 30th of May<p>
<br>
<h2>ABOUT<h2>
<hr>
<p>A symposium is generally defined as a meeting organized so that experts in a given field can meet, present papers, and discuss issues and trends or make recommendations for a certain course of action. Some definitions of symposium include a degree of audience participation that is less than that of a forum, thus implying a greater structure to the meeting format.</p>

<p>Symposiums have an implied academic aspect that distinguish them from seminars. After a symposium, attendees should come away having gained a greater degree of knowledge about a topic or a deeper understanding of an issue. They may have heard entirely new concepts about an existing subject or have been introduced to something completely new.</p>


<h2>SCIENCE SYMPODSIUM 2022<h2>
<hr>

<p>The Science Symposium is an annual event held each odd semester as part of AMRITA's Department of Research and Creativity. The Science Symposium showcases the scholarship and achievements of students from the School of Science and Technology and those receiving funding from the Center for Environmental Inquiry. Students present research posters and speak to attendees about their experiences. Public and community members are welcome to attend!

Faculty are encouraged to recruit students to present at the Symposium or to consider incorporating attendance into their class assignments. Participating in the Symposium is a great way for students to become actively involved in the science community and to gain experience in presenting their research.</p>
