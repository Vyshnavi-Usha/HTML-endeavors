<blockquote><p style="font-size:25px;">  Technical poster making typically is that you need to prepare and present a poster  when your work is not ready for a published paper or an official talk slot. The poster session permits one-on-one (or one-on-few) interaction . The greatest value of the poster is when you are standing in front of it, and you should optimize for that. During other times, it can still convey information to passers-by</p></blockquote>
