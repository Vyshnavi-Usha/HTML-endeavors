<blockquote><p style="font-size:25px;">Given the environmental threats associated with resource depletion and extraction practices, what is the future of our planetâ€™s natural resources? Some people argue that better technologies can increase the efficiency of extracting resource deposits from areas where resources have already been depleted. However, deposits will eventually become exhausted, even with the use of better technology.

The real sustainable future lies in developing diligent practices in our worldwide use of natural resources including conservation, recycling, and reuse of resources, and in the adoption of sustainable resource management strategies on national and local levels.</p></blockquote>
